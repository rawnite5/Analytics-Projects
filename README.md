We know life expectancy is positively related to GDP/capita, but after controlling for GDP/capita, 
weâ€™d like to know... 
1) Does income inequality explain variation in average life expectancy by country? 
a) How does income inequality, as calculated by the gini coefficient, vary by 
country? How have these relationships changed over time?
b) Does variation in income inequality explain variation in average life expectancy 
for specific time intervals? 
c) Do changes in income inequality for each country over time explain changes in 
life expectancies for each country over time? Does the answer to this depend on 
the country?
2) Does healthcare spending per capita explain variation in average life expectancy by 
country?
a) How does healthcare spending per capita vary by country? How have these 
relationships changed over time?
b) Does variation in healthcare spending per capita explain variation in average life 
expectancy for specific time intervals?
c) Do changes in healthcare spending per person for each country over time 
explain changes in life expectancies for each country over time? Does the 
answer to this depend on the country?
3) Does the relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy depend on the 
wealth of the country or its distribution of income?
a) Do countries with levels of income inequality have different relationships between 
healthcare spending per capita and life expectancy?
b) Do wealthier countries have different relationships between healthcare spending
